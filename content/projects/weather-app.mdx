## Overview

Weather Dashboard is a personal project I built to practice working with external APIs and data visualization. It provides current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and 7-day predictions.

## Features

- **Current Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind, and more
- **Hourly Forecast**: See what's coming in the next 24 hours
- **Weekly Outlook**: Plan your week with 7-day forecasts
- **Location Search**: Get weather for any city worldwide
- **Beautiful Charts**: Visualize temperature and precipitation trends

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard uses React with TypeScript for type safety. Weather data comes from the OpenWeatherMap API, and I used Recharts for the data visualizations.

```typescript
async function fetchWeather(city: string) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}`
  );
  return response.json();
}
```

## Design Philosophy

I focused on creating a clean, scannable interface that surfaces the most important information first. The color palette adapts based on the current weather conditions.
